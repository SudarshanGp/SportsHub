SportsHub : Your Solution To Sports

We decided to create a simple Chrome Extension that allows you to view live sports data through a Chrome Extension.
We focused on making the Extension simple and easy to use. Using a python script, we upload live data to Firebase which then updates the chrome extension.

To download and install:
1. Clone repository (or download the .zip file)
2. In a Google Chrome browser, navigate to Settings --> Extensions
3. Check the box at the top of the page "Developer mode"
4. Select "Load unpacked extension" and select the folder you downloaded from Github named "Extensino"
5. Chrome should now load the extension, with the "SH" logo at the top right of your browser
